Functional specifications

Project name : Fantasy Fight

Purpose : Creating a simple fantasy combat game.

Target :
Age 9 to 99. Everyone except blind people.

Target system : any

Interface : GUI

Personas :
Kira is a bajoran high qualified officer from Deep Space Nine Station. She has issues with her anger and wants to unwind whenever she has a spare minute, which is not really often. Since she’s very busy and can’t go to the gym as much as she wants, a little fight game is a useful means to get her stress out and resume her work minutes after.
Jake is a human teenager, son of Deep Space Nine’s commander. He’s very curious and loves funny retro things like ancient arcade games. He likes to play any kind of game with his best friend Nog and is very excited to try Fantasy Fight where he will have access to original and strange characters and enjoy the old-school atmosphere.

Functional Requirements : 
The game must be quick to play.
The game must have special features such as unusual fantasy races, weapons, spells.
Kira must be able to generate a character profile, equip this character with suitable weapons or spell and armour, and model hand-to-hand combat between character and one or multiple enemies. Each action must be text transcripted.

 
Expected results : 
All statistics should be integers in the (-50 ; 99) range.
Gold in posession should be integer in the (0 ; 5000) range.

Limitations: 
We need to make sure people will be able to lauch the game without prompting command interface.

Technical specifications :
